# Description:


The final project created is a To-do List built using the Python framework Flask. This implementation provides users with a To-do list where they can add tasks, view tasks, and then delete them once finished. Moreover, this implementation stores tasks continuously and utilizes SQLite as its database to do so. Additionally, this application was created to aid users with the effective organization of their tasks by offering a bare and simple interface that makes it easier for the user to efficiently manage what they need to get done throughout the day. Further, this application is set up so that each of the three parts are necessary for the usage and functionality of the code, including: app.py (flask application), test_app.py (unit tests), and index.html (html template).

Flask Application
The key component of this project is app.py because it entails the flask application logic, which consists of database initialization, task organization functions, and route handlers. First, the function that is obligated to set up the SQLite database is init_db(). This function makes a todo.db file and inserts a task table with 3 columns, including a unique identifier (id), task description (title), and a boolean flag to signify completed tasks (completed) once the application is run. Furthermore, a statement that is beneficial for development and testing while ensuring that the table is recreated already exists is ‘DROP TABLE IF EXISTS’. Next, the function that creates a connection with the SQLite database is get_db_connection (). This function permits accessing rows and obtaining them as dictionaries by positioning the row_factory parameter to sqlite3. Row, which makes it easier to utilize the data that is returned via database queries. In addition, the application is made up of three functions: add_task(title), get_tasks(), and delete_task(task_id). The add_task(title) function inputs current tasks into the tasks table and then uses the task title as input and performs a SQL statement to put in the tasks list. The get_tasks() function pulls all the tasks from the task table and performs an SQL select statement, which results in a list of rows. The delete_task(task_id) function removes tasks based on their ID from the task table by performing an SQL delete statement to delete the finished tasks. The three routes that this implementation defines are /, /add, and /delete/<int:task_id>. The / route is the root route that contains the index.html template, which moves the tasks to the template for presentation. The /add route deals with the form submission for integrating a current task by grabbing the task title from the form data and calling the add_task() function, which directs the user back to the start page. The /delete/<int:task_id> route deals with the removal of a task by withdrawing the task id from the URL and calling the delete_task function, which redirects the user back to the start page. Through the integration of the main() function, the database is initialized and starts the Flask database server, which runs the application with the debugger, offers helpful error responses, and automatically reloads the server when adjustments are executed. 

Unit Tests
The file that has the unit tests for the application is the test_app.py file. These unit tests guarantee that the task addition function, data initialization function, and task deletion function operate as anticipated. Additionally, the fixture that sets up the Flask application to be tested is the client fixture, which initializes the database and delivers a test that is utilized with the purpose of stimulating HTTP requests. Furthermore, the fixture gets rid of the todo.db to guarantee a bare slate for subsequent tests once the test is finished. The test_init_db(client) test confirms whether or not the database has been initialized properly while also confirming that the todo.db file exists and that a task table was created. The test_add_task(client) test confirms whether or not tasks can be added to the database while adding tasks, retrieving the task list, and checking if the task was added properly. The test_delete_task(client) test confirms whether or not tasks can be deleted from the database while adding a task and then removing it from the task list to ensure that the task list returns empty.

HTML Template
The user interface for this implementation is index.html, which is a basic HTML template that shows the list of tasks and offers a form for inputting current tasks. The index.html template contains a form with a text input for inputting tasks as well as a submit button to include the new task in the task list. The <ul> lists the tasks in an unordered list while <li> makes each task a list item, including a task title and delete link. Additionally, the function used to generate the URL to delete a task is url_for(), which is also the delete link. Furthermore, this project utilizes the Jinga2templating syntax to vigorously create the list of tasks by integrating the loop {% for task in tasks %}, which goes over the tasks passed to the template and generates the corresponding HTML for each and every task. 

SQlite Database
SQlite was used for this project because it was a familiar database engine. It being a serverless engine also meant not running into as many issues, simplifying the coding process. SQlite is very straightforward to use and makes the functionality of the program easy to achieve. 

Flask 
Flask is a small web development framework that provides simplicity and flexibility. While full-stack frameworks like Django come with most of the components required for web development, Flask provides only the components needed to get started and lets users add features on top of it. Hence, it is perfect for small projects like this one and for learning the basics of web development.

No User Authentication 
For this specific project, the implementation of user authentication was opted out. Its not implemented due to the intended single user usage, as well as the complexity of adding this feature. While it would be a useful feature, it would be too hard to code from scratch and ensure functionality with the rest of the code. That said, it could be something added down the road. 

Features
This version of the program meets the requirements needed for the assignment. Regardless, in the future, this could be improved with the following upgrades:
Visual upgrades: Adding the function to mark tasks as complete and implementing a visual indicator alongside it, such as a strikethrough or emoji. Additionally, making the UI and overall application more visually appealing was attempted but was hard to nail down, so it was not completed. 
Categorization: Allowing users to categorize and organize their tasks in subsections would add complexity and enhance the functionality of the code in the long run. 

The application has the functional and overt function of serving as a space where users can list upcoming tasks and remove them upon completion. It shows the seamless implementation of Flask as a web development tool alongside SQlite as a database. Similarly, pytest was implemented for testing purposes. The project serves as a great canvas for future upgrades to improve the use case for it while allowing beginners to learn the basics of Python alongside the other programs.
